Living Earth Education provides training in the characterisation, mapping, monitoring and futuring of land and water, with local to global application across spatial and temporal scales.  The repository contains training material that is progressively updated alongside the development of Living Earth concepts, capability and functionality..

## ðŸš€ Getting started and python environment set up

To run these notebook, **launch a GitHub CodeSpace** cloud instance by clicking the badge below. The session will contain all the necessary python libraries and the notebooks and code in this repo.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/cbur24/aberystwyth_training_material?quickstart=1)


> [!TIP]
> Allow CodeSpaces a few minutes to bootup and for all python libraries to install. 
> To **open Jupyterlab** within the default VSCode session (if you perfer that IDE), in the terminal run `jupyter lab --no-browser --NotebookApp.token=''`, and jupyter lab will open in a seperate browser tab. Note, you may have to **disable any pop-up blockers** in your browser. Alternatively, you can configure your Github CodeSpaces settings to open Jupyterlab by default; go to [Editor preferences](https://github.com/settings/codespaces).

> [!WARNING]  
> When you open a Codespace, the compute time is billed to **your own GitHub account** (using your free monthly allowance or any paid plan you may have).
> [Free users](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces) get 120 compute hours per month. The compute size set up for this repo is **4 cores, 16GB RAM, 15GB of storage.** On a free account, this means you have 30 free hours of usage per month.
