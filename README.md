# Aberystwyth University _Living Earth_ Training Material

## ðŸš€ Getting started and python environment set up

To run these notebook, **launch a GitHub CodeSpace** cloud instance by clicking the badge below. The session will contain all the necessary python libraries and the notebooks and code in this repo.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/cbur24/aberystwyth_training_material?quickstart=1)


> [!TIP]
> Allow CodeSpaces a few minutes to bootup and for all python libraries to install. 
> To **open Jupyterlab** within the default VSCode session (if you perfer that IDE), in the terminal run `jupyter lab --no-browser --NotebookApp.token=''`, and jupyter lab will open in a seperate browser tab. Note, you may have to **disable any pop-up blockers** in your browser. Alternatively, you can configure your Github CodeSpaces settings to open Jupyterlab by default; go to [Editor preferences](https://github.com/settings/codespaces).

> [!WARNING]  
> When you open a Codespace, the compute time is billed to **your own GitHub account** (using your free monthly allowance or any paid plan you may have).
> [Free users](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-codespaces) get 120 compute hours per month. The compute size set up for this repo is **4 cores, 16GB RAM, 15GB of storage.** On a free account, this means you have 30 free hours of usage per month.
